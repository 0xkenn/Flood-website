<!---------------------------------------------Causes of Floods ---------------------------------------------------------------->
    <header>
        <h1>Causes of Flood</h1>
        <p style="margin: 0 100px;">Floods can have a variety of sources. Although many different things might cause floods, most of them are caused by the elements. 
            Floods are caused by both natural and man-made factors. Floods do severe damage to local property as well as to the flora and fauna</p>

            <p style="
            text-align: justify;
            text-indent: 40px;">When we consider the causes of the flood, rainfall is at the top of the list. When it rains, well-designed drainage systems and infrastructure substantially help to provide precipitation with the right path to water reservoirs, where it may fall and the water level be maintained at a steady level. However, this system is inadequate during periods of heavy precipitation, which results in flooding. Additionally, towns without such sophisticated systems suffer more as a result of their inability to deal with periods of heavy rain and flooding.</p>

            <p style="
            text-align: justify;
            text-indent: 40px;">A larger risk to their life exists for those who live near the shores of rivers and oceans. Any storm or river flood could cause a lot of problems. In order to address these problems, dams are constructed to hold back the water. However, if they are not properly maintained, they can also result in floods, which can result in significant property damage and even fatalities.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

            <p style="
            text-align: justify;
            text-indent: 40px;">As was already said, dams built to control flooding and generate energy can potentially result in major flooding. After a heavy downpour, water instantly begins to accumulate around dwellings when they are unable to contain any more. The flooding situation for the local population gets worse as these damâ€™s break</p>

            <p style="
            text-align: justify;
            text-indent: 40px;">Floods are caused by deforestation, which also significantly contributes to a variety of other problems like soil erosion. The continuing destruction of trees for both personal and business reasons is referred to as deforestation. Many things have been destroyed as a result of the human-caused flood. The profusion of trees not only enhances the flora, but also significantly contributes to soil binding and crop protection. Trees are careful to block the flow of rainwater in order to prevent flooding.</p>

            <p style="
            text-align: justify;
            text-indent: 40px;">Flooding is more likely to occur in a place due to climate change, which is a result of bad human conduct. Practices like deforestation raise the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide because plants cannot use it when they are not present. As atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide increase, more heat is trapped there, causing climate change. Climate change is a significant contributor to several natural disasters, particularly floods.</p>

            <p style="
            text-align: justify;
            text-indent: 40px;"> greenhouse effect refers to the process by which gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and others trap solar heat. As greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere, a number of problems, including the weakening of the ozone layer, occur. This makes the emission of greenhouse gases a key factor in the occurrence of floods caused by human activities. The increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases is due to human activities such as industrial production, the burning of fossil fuels like coal and petroleum, and other similar activities.</p>

    <!-------------------------------Types of Flooding------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

    <header>
        <h1>Types of Flooding</h1>
        <p style="margin: 0 100px;">Flooding can be classified into several types. Although there are many categories into which 
            the many flood kinds can be grouped, this is simply a summary. 
            Floods typically appear in a variety of forms</p>
    </header>

            <h2><a href="https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/hurricanestormsurge/">1.Surge Floods</a></h2>
            <p style="
            text-align: justify;
            text-indent: 40px;">These floods are the ones caused by tidal surges, storm tides, storm surges, and other occurrences that take place in the ocean or sea. 
                They are a particular type of coastal flood that occur along the shore. When dry land areas of the world are flooded in seawater for a
                 variety of reasons, floods along the coast result.
                 Depending on how much seawater or ocean is involved in the storm surges and hurricanes, floods can spread more or less catastrophically</p>

            <p style="
            text-align: justify;
            text-indent: 40px;">Contrary to popular belief, both urban regions and rural villages are susceptible to pluvial floods.
                 This defies the notion that flooding would only cause damage to those who were near a body of water.
                  It takes place as a result of extended periods of intense rain and any water body overflowing.
                   Small floods cause a lot of harm even if they may not contain a lot of water. Both the ecology and
                    the infrastructure have been severely damaged by this disaster. 
                The two primary forms of pluvial floods are as follows:</p>

            <br>
            These floods occur when the urban drainage system malfunctions, allowing water to overflow into the streets and residences of the neighborhood and disturb daily life. Despite the fact that it doesn't represent a serious threat to life and develops gradually, giving the local population time to evacuate to safer locations, 
            it nonetheless causes substantial resource devastation.</p>

                They are the kind of floods when water spreads swiftly and at a high speed as a result of a brief but intense downpour. These floods may also come from the abrupt discharge of a dam or water that has been stored higher up. These floods occur very swiftly and spread across the land in a very short period of time. Additionally, when it comes to destruction, these floods are especially damaging due to the hurtling debris that is frequently swept up in the water flow and the extremely
                 fast water flow that occurs during flash floods. Greater environmental harm is caused by it than by surface water floods</p>

            text-indent: 40px;">This is characterized by slow riverbank overflows brought on by heavy rainfall that lasts for a long time. 
                The size of the river and the amount of rainfall affect the places that flood during river events. Although 
                river floods rarely result in fatalities, they can nonetheless cause significant economic harm</p>

            <p style="
            text-align: justify;
            text-indent: 40px;">This flood happens when a city's or town's drainage system is unable to adequately absorb the water following a si
                gnificant downpour. In an urban setting, poor natural drainage can also lead to flooding. Driving is quite unsafe
                 due to water spilling into the road. Even though the water may only be a few inches deep, urban floods can seriously harm structures.</p>

                text-align: justify;
                text-indent: 40px;">Floods have significant negative effects on the environment as well as the social and economic spheres.
                 It is one of the worst disasters that man has to face. As most people are well aware, flooding has a number of immediate effects,
                 including the loss of life, destruction of property, loss of crops and livestock, and worsening of health due to waterborne infections.  </p>
<br>
        <p style="margin: 0 100px;
        text-align: justify;
        text-indent: 40px;">Although floods can be disastrous to urban areas, studies have shown that they have
         always played a crucial role in nature's restoration process and have many long-lasting benefits. Among them are:</p>

        text-align: justify;
        text-indent: 40px;">floods help maintain the health of ecologically significant wetlands.
         Floods bring and deposit nutrient-rich sediments that support plant and animal life in wetlands while simultaneously 
         flooding them with fresh water. 
        Floods also enrich lakes and streams with nutrients that support robust fishing.</p>

    <h1>Dangers of Floods</h1>
    <p style="margin: 0 100px; 
                text-align: justify;
                text-indent: 40px;">In the midst of a heavy storm or aftermath of a typhoon, flooding presents a number of dangers to consider. 
                One major problem is the adverse effects of pollution on floodwater. From infectious diseases to toxic fumes, your health is put at risk.
                 With the many dangers of flood water, itâ€™s important for you to think twice before wading through any flooded areas. Floodwater picks up 
                 an impressive collection of everything it touches as it spreads. Trash, oil, insects, snakes, biological waste, and more are just a handful 
                 of the hidden hazards just below the surface.
                 Here are a few other ways floodwater can put you in danger:  </p>

        <p style="
        text-align: justify;
        text-indent: 40px;">Floods often carry waste from sewers or farms, filling the water with all sorts of nasty bacteria. Even floodwaters that havenâ€™t picked up biohazards can contain potentially dangerous bacteria, especially legionella, which can give  you a potentially deadly strain of pneumonia. Any of these bacteria-ridden hazards could infect an open wound,
         even a tiny cut, if you walk into floodwaters. Donâ€™t take that risk.</p>

        text-indent: 40px;">Plenty of vehicles leak oil or other engine fluids on a regular basis. Floodwaters pick up that residue and spread it everywhere. A damaged gas station leaking fuel only contributes to this contamination.
         You never know what chemicals <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/extreme-weather/floods-standingwater.html">standing water</a> picked up on its way to settle near youâ€“play it safe and donâ€™t let yourself get contaminated.</p>

        text-indent: 40px;">According to <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.weather.gov/tsa/hydro_tadd">NOAA</a>, a mere six inches of rushing water can knock an adult down and 1-2 feet 
        of water can stall and sweep away most cars. Donâ€™t let the site of shallow water lull you into a false sense of security. 
        Currents are deadly. Keep children out of the water and never walk in floodwaters yourself,

                text-align: justify;
                text-indent: 40px;">When weâ€™re faced with flash floods or major storms, it can be difficult to stay healthy during the cleanup process. 
                Donâ€™t forget to wash your hands with antibacterial soap or wear protective clothing to ensure your safety. Additionally,
                 make sure you have a reliable way to protect against flooding so that you can minimize your risk of illness or injury. </p>
