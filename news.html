          <p>a massive flash flood hit Leyte's Ormoc City. Approximately 8,000 people across Ormoc perished in the flood. Isla Verde, a densely populated region close to the city center, had severe flash flooding because of Typhoon Uring (also known as Thelma globally). Such an occurrence that resulted in a landslide and the inability of the area to contain the water due 
            to its capacity being exceeded was caused by illegal logging and deforestation.</p>
