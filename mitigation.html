        <h1>Flood Mitigation Techniques</h1>
        <p style="margin: 0 100px;">When thinking about structural solutions for flood mitigation, it is crucial to comprehend the effectiveness of different measures in terms of the impact on flood mitigation. There may be a multitude of structural and non-structural mitigating techniques available, depending on the location and the type of flooding. Flood mitigation strategies,
             however, might merely minimize the effects of flooding. Heavy rain or high seas cannot be stopped, regardless matter what is done.</p>

            text-indent: 40px;">Structural measures include physical construction to lessen or eliminate the effects of potential hazards, as well as the use of engineering methods or technology to increase the resilience and hazard resistance of systems or structures.
             The following are typical structural methods for flood risk reduction:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Dams</li>
                <li>Flood Levies</li>

        <p>Non-structural measures are actions taken to lessen the risks and effects of disasters
             without the use of physical construction, such as regulations and legislation, public awareness campaigns,
              training, and education. Common non - structural measures include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Public Education Initiatives</li>
                <li>Controls for Land use Planning</li>

        <h2>Flood Advisory</h2>
        <p>
            - A flood condition is indicated by a flood advisory, which is a warning. It offers recommendations for the necessary activities that the community and inhabitants of the affected region may need to take. When the hydrological situation gets worse, a warning is given.
             It is also issued when a condition is unquestionably getting better but still calls for vigilance. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            Flood Warning
        </h2>
        <p>
            - Flood Warning is given when it is clear that there will be flooding at least 23 hours before it actually happens. This category
             is retained in subsequent bulletins so long as the affected areas are flooded and the associated threats exist.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Flood bulletins
        </h2>
        <p>
            - Publicity is a specific focus of flood bulletins.
             They are meant to inform those who live in the threatened area about the current situation as well as the future course of events. It makes recommendations on the best steps the community should take to either prevent or lessen the terrible effects of a flood.
