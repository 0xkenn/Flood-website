          <p>As we live our lives at the pace we usually do, we tend to ignore the risks that nature can provide at any time. Natural calamities occasionally remind us of the flip side of the coin that nature can also be all lovely and refreshing. Natural disaster is those that occur as a result of the forces of nature. Resources like air and water are present in the ecosystem for the benefit of biological life, but a slight disturbance in them results in catastrophic calamities: flood is one of them. Floods are wrecking threats not only to the life of the individuals but also result in long-term destruction to the economy, environment, and psychological state of the affected individuals. A slight disturbance in a geographical area’s climatic conditions and natural cycles like heavy rainfall and extra precipitation result in floods. </p>
          
          <p>The Hydrological Service of Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) defines a flood as “an abnormal progressive rise in the water level of a stream that may result in the overflowing water of the normal confines of the stream with the subsequent inundation of areas which are not normally submerged”.</p>
          
          <p>The “Manual of Operational Procedures on Flood Forecasting and Warning” states: </p>
          
          <p style="border-style: solid;">“From a strict hydrological sense, flood is defined as a rise, usually brief, in the water level in a stream to a peak from which the water level recedes at a slower rate (UNESCO-WMO 1974). The episodic behavior of a river that may be considered a flood is then termed a “flood event” (Linsley, 1942) which is described as a flow of water in a stream constituting a distinct progressive rise, culminating in a crest, together with the recession that follows the crest (Linsley, 1942).”</p>
          
          <p>Floods, frequently brought on by typhoons, have always been a problem for the Philippines. The following list includes some of the Philippines' worst floods: <a class="news"href=""><p style="*{margin: 0;padding: 0;}">News</p></a></p>
