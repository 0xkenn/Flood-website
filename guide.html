        •	Have a meeting with the community and the community leaders to review the proceedings during and after flooding. Draw lessons that can be learned and discuss where it went wrong, difficulties encountered, setbacks as well as successes.
         Try to accommodate all recommendations in the list of preparedness actions for the next flood.
    </p>
    <p>
        •	Encourage community members to participate in the cleanup of the environment and common areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        •	Plant bamboo or appropriate trees around the houses and in the common areas to prevent erosion.
    </p>
    <p>
        •	Stop cutting trees. Instead, plant trees. They provide strong natural protection against floods.
